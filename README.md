FGBENet: Frequency-domain Global Boundary Enhancement Network

Introduction

üå±FGBENet (Frequency-domain Global Boundary Enhancement Network) is a multitask deep learning framework for agricultural parcel delineation from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.
It integrates two novel modules:

1.Frequency-domain Global Gated Attention (FGGA): Enhances long-range dependency modeling and cross-scale consistency by leveraging frequency-domain attention with gating.

2.Gated Boundary Enhancement (GBE): Refines fine-grained boundaries with gated convolutions, improving the clarity and continuity of ridges, ditches, and crop rows.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
git clone https://github.com/liye1213/FGBENET.git
cd FGBENET
pip install -r requirements.txt

üöÄ Usage
import torch

from FGBENet import Field

model = Field()

x = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

outputs = model(x)

mask, edge, distance = outputs
