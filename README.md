# FGBENet: Frequency-domain Global Boundary Enhancement Network

## üå± Introduction
**FGBENet** (Frequency-domain Global Boundary Enhancement Network) is a multitask deep learning framework for **agricultural parcel delineation** from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.  
It integrates two novel modules:

1. **Frequency-domain Global Gated Attention (FGGA)**  
   Enhances long-range dependency modeling and cross-scale consistency by leveraging frequency-domain attention with gating.  

2. **Gated Boundary Enhancement (GBE)**  
   Refines fine-grained boundaries with gated convolutions, improving the clarity and continuity of ridges, ditches, and crop rows.
